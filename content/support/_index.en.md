You could contribute to the research community through the following ways.

First, if you are the author of some psychometric tools, you are invited to distribute your tools (scales, inventories) through **Academy of Psychometric Site**. You should allow users to use your tools for non-commercial purposes without charges. Please submit your psychometric tools to qingyaozhang@yeah.net. You are also invited to provide your way of collecting donations from prospective users.

Second, users should cite the source literature of the tools you use, which affords the corresponding authors adequate credits. Though this is a kind of basic ethic code for researchers, some researchers did bad.

Third, users could consider donating to the authors of the tools if the authors provided a way of collecting donations.
