# 量表简介

卷入到校园欺凌事件的学生不仅仅包含欺凌者和受害者，也包含协助者(协助欺凌者的学生)、局外人(袖手旁观的学生)、捍卫者(捍卫受害者的学生)。为了有效减少校园欺凌，为了有效提高卷入到校园欺凌事件的所有学生的身心健康，我们有必要对卷入到校园欺凌事件的多种角色进行调查。为此，我们需要一个能有效评估多种校园欺凌参与行为的测量工具。校园欺凌参与行为问卷(Bullying Participant Behaviors Questionnaire, BPBQ)可以满足这一需要(Demaray, Summers, Jenkins, & Becker, 2016)。张庆垚等人(2019)基于中国3-12年级的学生对该量表进行了翻译和修订，证明中文版BPBQ的信效度良好。交叉滞后模型的结果表明，不同的欺凌参与行为(欺凌者、协助者、受害者、局外人、捍卫者)与大五人格和心理健康可以相互预测。

  使用者须注意BPBQ的英文版和中文版是不同的。BPBQ的英文最终版从80个初始题项中剔除了30个题项，因此BPBQ的英文最终版仅包含50个题项（每个维度包含10个题项）。但是，中文版BPBQ翻译并保留了BPBQ的所有80个初始题项，张庆垚的研究表明80个题项的中文版BPBQ信效度良好。另外，英文版和中文版采用的计分方式也不同。
